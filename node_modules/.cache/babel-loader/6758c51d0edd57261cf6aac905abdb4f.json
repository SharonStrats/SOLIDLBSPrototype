JWT Claims\n *\n *   The JWT Claims Set represents a JSON object whose members are the\n *   claims conveyed by the JWT.  The Claim Names within a JWT Claims Set\n *   MUST be unique; JWT parsers MUST either reject JWTs with duplicate\n *   Claim Names or use a JSON parser that returns only the lexically last\n *   duplicate member name, as specified in Section 15.12 (\"The JSON\n *   Object\") of ECMAScript 5.1 [ECMAScript].\n *\n *   The set of claims that a JWT must contain to be considered valid is\n *   context dependent and is outside the scope of this specification.\n *   Specific applications of JWTs will require implementations to\n *   understand and process some claims in particular ways.  However, in\n *   the absence of such requirements, all claims that are not understood\n *   by implementations MUST be ignored.\n *\n *   There are three classes of JWT Claim Names: Registered Claim Names,\n *   Public Claim Names, and Private Claim Names.\n */\n\n\nvar JWTClaimsSetSchema = new JSONSchema({\n  properties: {\n    /**\n     * JSON Web Token (JWT)\n     * https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1\n     *\n     * 4.1.
